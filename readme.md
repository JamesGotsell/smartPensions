need to test the querie

- run with the graphql wrapper running locally

  - https://github.com/JamesGotsell/swapi-graphql - need to update the port so its so port doesn't change

  # FYI

  - some issues with the swapi api
  - i had to get fork the graphql server and use locally
  - if you have any issues with connection - cors error
    its a little wierd as i can make a starship query and theres not issues - only a issue for the character query
    - git clone https://github.com/JamesGotsell/swapi-graphql
    - npm install
    - npm start
    - take the localhost server url and had to the url section in index.ts

  # issus with the graphlq query not returning correct data from the

  ```
   const [results, resultsError, isLoadingResults ] = useResultsQuery()
    the useResultQuery not returning the data in the winningObject in cache
    const personData = (name, height) => {
      return <><p>with the person: {name}  that had a height of: {height} </p></>
    }
    const starShipData = (model, hyperdriveRating) => {
      return <><p>with the starShip: {model}  that had a hyperdriveRating of: {hyperdriveRating} </p></>
    }
    const renderResults = () => {
     return <>
              <p> the last game {wonBy != "draw" ? ` was wonBy ${wonBy}` : `was a draw` }</p>
               {  winningObject.name &&  personData(winningObject.name, winningObject.height)}
               {  winningObject.model &&  personData(winningObject.model, winningObject.hyperdriveRating)}
            </>
    }
